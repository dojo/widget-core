A core widget library for Dojo 2.

**WARNING** This is *alpha* software. It is not yet production ready, so you should use at your own risk.

For more background on Widgets for Dojo 2, there is a document describing the [widgeting system](https://github.com/dojo/meta/blob/master/documents/Widget-System.md).

## Features

Dojo 2 Widgets are based on a virtual DOM implementation named [Maquette](http://maquettejs.org/) as well as some foundational classes
provided in [dojo-compose](https://github.com/dojo/compose).

To see how the widgets are utilised, there is an [example application](https://github.com/kitsonk/app-example) available.  Currently, outside of the source distribution itself, there is not a lot of documentation, as the code base is under heavy development.
